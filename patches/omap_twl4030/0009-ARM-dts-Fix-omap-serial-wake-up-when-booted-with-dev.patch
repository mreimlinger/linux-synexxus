Subject: [PATCH 09/15] ARM: dts: Fix omap serial wake-up when booted with
 device tree
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We've had deeper idle states working on omaps for few years now,
but only in the legacy mode. When booted with device tree, the
wake-up events did not have a chance to work until commit
3e6cee1786a1 (pinctrl: single: Add support for wake-up interrupts)
that recently got merged. In addition to that we also needed commit
79d9701559a9 (of/irq: create interrupts-extended property) that's
now also merged.

So let's fix the wake-up events for some selected omaps so devices
booted in device tree mode won't just hang if deeper power states
are enabled, and so systems can wake up from suspend to the serial
port event.

Note that there's no longer need to specify the wake-up bit in
the pinctrl settings, the request_irq on the wake-up pin takes
care of that.
