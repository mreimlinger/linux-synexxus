* Allwinner sunxi MMC controller

The highspeed MMC host controller on Allwinner SoCs provides an interface
for MMC, SD and SDIO types of memory cards.

Supported maximum speeds are the ones of the eMMC standard 4.5 as well
as the speed of SD standard 3.0.
Absolute maximum transfer rate is 200MB/s

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "allwinner,<revision>-<chip>-mmc".
  The supported chips include a10, a10s, 13, a20 and a31.
- base registers are 0x1000 appart, so the base of mmc1
  would be 0x01c0f000+0x1000=0x01c10000(see example)
  and so on.
- clocks requires the reference at the ahb clock gate
  with the correct index (mmc0 -> 8, mmc1 -> 9, and so on)
  as well as the reference to the correct mod0 clock.
- interrupts requires the correct IRQ line
  (mmc0 -> 32, mmc1 -> 33, and so on)

Examples:

mmc0: mmc@01c0f000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun5i-a13-mmc";
	reg = <0x01c0f000 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&ahb_gates 8>, <&mmc0_clk>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "mod";
	interrupts = <0 32 4>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	status = "disabled";
};
